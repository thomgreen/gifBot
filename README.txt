A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/blaketarter/pen/wBgWbV.

 Quick example of the [Giphy Api](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI) which is pretty cool if you ask me. Just type in a search phase and get a random related GIF.

I also decided to go nuts and use [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) features (like let, const, fat arrow function syntax and string templates) and the [Traceur Compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) just to play around with whats coming up in the next generation of javascript, some pretty cool stuff.
